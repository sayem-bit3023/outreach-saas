# Lead Intelligence Platform — Demo

A polished demo of the **Lead Intelligence** SaaS product for agencies.

This repository validates the core discovery experience:

```
FIND → SEARCH → QUEUE → PROCESS → RESULTS → SAVE
```

---

## Product

Agencies need a reliable way to:

1. **Find** businesses worth contacting
2. **Understand** why they are potential prospects
3. Eventually **contact and follow up** with them

This demo focuses exclusively on the **find / search / queue / results / save** loop.  
Real lead providers, outreach, and billing are intentionally out of scope.

---

## Current Flow

```
User creates a search (business type + location + count)
        ↓
Search job enters the queue
        ↓
Up to 2 jobs process concurrently
        ↓
MockLeadProvider returns progressive results
        ↓
User views results, saves interesting leads
        ↓
Usage is charged only for leads actually discovered
```

Multiple searches can be created without waiting. Extra jobs wait in a queue and automatically start when a slot frees up.

---

## Architecture

### Provider abstraction

```
LeadProvider (interface)
    └── MockLeadProvider   ← implemented now
    └── (future) GooglePlacesProvider
    └── (future) PrivateCoffeeOverpassProvider
    └── (future) PremiumProvider
```

The UI never contains provider-specific logic.

### Search job simulation

Client-side `SearchManager` simulates an asynchronous job queue:

- Statuses: `queued` → `searching` → `collecting` → `checking` → `completed` | `cancelled` | `error`
- Max **2 concurrent** active jobs
- Queue advances automatically when a job finishes or is cancelled
- Partial results are kept on cancel
- Occasional simulated failures with retry

### Persistence

All state lives in `localStorage`:

- Searches & status
- Generated leads
- Saved leads
- Usage (Free plan: 100 discoveries)

Refreshing the page restores state. In-progress jobs are marked **cancelled** on reload (there is no real background worker in the browser).

### Data separation

```
Search  ≠  Lead  ≠  SavedLead  ≠  Usage
```

This separation is intentional so a future Supabase migration stays straightforward.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 15** (App Router)
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Lucide React** (icons)
- No separate backend — pure client-side demo

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Deploying to Vercel

This existing GitHub repository is ready to import into Vercel:

1. Open [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and choose **Add New Project**.
2. Connect GitHub if it is not connected yet.
3. Select the existing `sayemw838-cmyk/outreach-saas` repository.
4. Vercel detects the Next.js App Router project automatically.
5. Keep the default build settings and deploy.

No environment variables are required. The current project is a browser-only demo using fictional mock lead data and localStorage; it does not use API keys, external lead providers, authentication, or a database.

---

## Current Limitations

| Limitation | Reason |
|---|---|
| Processing runs in the browser | Demo only — no real worker |
| Interrupted jobs become cancelled on refresh | Browser cannot keep background timers |
| Mock data only | Real providers (Overpass, Google Places, etc.) come later |
| No authentication | Will use Supabase Auth later |
| Free plan is simulated | No Stripe / billing yet |
| Usage resets only via Settings | Demo convenience |

---

## Future Architecture

```
Next.js (App Router)
    +
Supabase (Auth, Postgres, Realtime)
    +
Server-side Lead Providers
    +
Background Workers / Queue (e.g. Inngest, Trigger.dev, or custom)
    +
Email finding, verification, AI qualification
    +
Outreach sequences & reply tracking
    +
Stripe billing
```

The current code is structured so `LocalStorage*` repositories can be replaced with `Supabase*` implementations without rewriting the UI or job orchestration concepts.
